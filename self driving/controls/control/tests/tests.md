## Path Planning
This is only the first mode of testing for the functions. This is not the final test. HIL testing yet to be done

### TO DO

- FIX:- fix the typeerror. Find an alternative for interpolation 
- Find a more intelligent way to design the desired_polyfit.
- desired_polyfit needs fixing
- Update needs fixing along with the model outputs.
- BUG FIX - the weighted average gets into weird issues during interpolation.
- Find a clever way to compute the predicted path.
- speed and model needs to be set.
 
#### FIXED: :heavy_check_mark:
 - way to do path planning
 - desired_polyfit and centre_probability consistent with test passing. 
 - Type Error fixed.

- value prediction networks
- hierarchial memory structure
- episodic memory
- attention mechanisms
