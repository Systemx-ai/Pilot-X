**Let's solve X.**

Inspired by Daniel Kahneman's Book- Thinking fast and slow, we have decided to divide self driving into two systems. System 1 and System 2. 
The X in System-X is either 1 or 2 or any infinite number of systems/modes of thought that one can come up with.

#### System 1 and System 2

The central thesis in the book is a dichotomy between two modes of thought: System 1 and System 2.
"System 1" is fast, instinctive and emotional; "System 2" is slower, more deliberative, and more logical.
In autonomous driving, how a system reacts to perception(as an example) can be attributed to System 1 and  to System 2. In other words, depending on how difficult the learning 
problem is, the result needs to be characteristic of both System 1 and System 2.

#### System 1:
**Fast, automatic, frequent, emotional, stereotypic, unconscious. Examples of things system 1 can do:**
- determine that an object is at a greater distance than another
- localize the source of a specific sound
- complete the phrase "war and ..."
- display disgust when seeing a gruesome image
- solve 2+2=?
- read text on a billboard
- drive a car on an empty road etc.

#### System 2:
**Slow, effortful, infrequent, logical, calculating, conscious.**
Examples of things system 2 can do:
- brace yourself before the start of a sprint
- direct your attention towards the clowns at the circus
- direct your attention towards someone at a loud party
- dig into your memory to recognize a sound
- sustain a higher than normal walking rate
- determine the appropriateness of a particular behavior in a social setting etc.

### What do we need to solve in self driving ?

**Goal for System-X**

> We already have a self driving car. It's called a taxi. If you are at all familiar with self driving , you have heard of companies like Tesla , Waymo, comma ai  etc and the work they have been doing. Elon Musk last year had promised full self driving or FSD. Tesla currently as of this writing (May, 2020) is winning  with Level 2 autonomous driving. But, to actually solve self driving (here in India) , we need to solve or atleast understand how human behaviour works. The Human factor on both ends still remains a challenge, because of abstractions. Right now, whatever you see in level 2 development is System 1. We here at System-X will improve System 1 and Build System 2.  Human driving is not great, (i.e, if you look at the average quality of driving). Good drivers and Bad drivers can be seperated into clusters. Solving a system 2 problem, will require an understanding of human bias/intention. Also, the bias of system 1 can be overruled by System 2. Deep learning is taking care (perception problems) of the fast, automatic aspect but System 1 on its own isn't going to be enough. To get to Level 5 , we need more. We need a combination of two systems that can be QM. System 1 can be learned over time , but System 2 is much more slower, making it difficult to attain. The problem of Static Driving can be solved by system 1 , but solving dynamic driving and human intention will require system 2.

"So, you are all welcome to join this extraordinary journey as we try and figure out a combination of System 1 and System 2 to take self driving to level 5. Reliability over time...!!
