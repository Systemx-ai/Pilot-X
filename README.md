**Let's solve for X. Together we will solve self driving.**

Inspired by Daniel Kahneman's Book- Thinking fast and slow, we have decided to divide self driving into two systems. System 1 and System 2. 
The X in System X is either 1 or 2 or any infinite number of systems/modes of thought that one can come up with. Whether its the way we react to situations which affect perception or the way others behave that directly has an impact on our 
behaviour. 

#### System 1 and System 2

The central thesis in the book is a dichotomy between two modes of thought: System 1 and System 2.
"System 1" is fast, instinctive and emotional; "System 2" is slower, more deliberative, and more logical.

#### System 1:
**Fast, automatic, frequent, emotional, stereotypic, unconscious. Examples of things system 1 can do:**
- determine that an object is at a greater distance than another
- localize the source of a specific sound
- complete the phrase "war and ..."
- display disgust when seeing a gruesome image
- solve 2+2=?
- read text on a billboard
- drive a car on an empty road etc.

#### System 2:
**Slow, effortful, infrequent, logical, calculating, conscious.**
Examples of things system 2 can do:
- brace yourself before the start of a sprint
- direct your attention towards the clowns at the circus
- direct your attention towards someone at a loud party
- look out for the woman with the grey hair
- dig into your memory to recognize a sound
- sustain a higher than normal walking rate
- determine the appropriateness of a particular behavior in a social setting etc.

### What do we need to solve in self driving ?

We already have a self driving car. It's called a taxi. If you are at all familiar with self driving , you have heard of companies like Tesla , Waymo, comma ai  etc and the work they have been doing. Elon Musk last year had promised full self driving or FSD. Tesla currently as of this writing (May, 2020) is winning  with Level 2 autonomous driving. But, to actually solve self driving  , we need to solve or atleast understand how human behaviour works. The Human factor on both ends still remains a challenge. 
Human driving is not great, (i.e, if you look at the overall quality of driving). Truly solving self driving will require solving how the human factor and bias works. Deep learning is taking care of the fast, automatic aspect but System 1 on its own isn't going to cut it. We need more. We need a combination of two systems
that can deliver performance. System 1 which is automatic and System 2 which is logical and calculating. Kahneman focuses much of the book on the
interactions of System 1 and System 2. System 1 can be learnt over time , but System 2 is much more slower, making it difficult to attain.

So, you are all welcome to join this extraordinary journey where we try to figure out a combination of System 1 and System 2 to take self driving to level 5. The end result can be anything.


### Maybe you are asking what happens when X approaches the limit of human intelligence. 

Well in that case, the System converges..!!
