### About

We here at System-X are currently working towards perfecting level 2 autonomous driving in India.
Pilot-X is an open source Driver's assistance system (Currently under development). This organisation is being developed in good faith to be compliant with the Motor Vehicles Amendment Act(2019) under new section 2B - Promotion of innovation.

### Goal

The goal of System-X is not different from that of comma ai. System-X plans on shipping a cost effective self driving car kit, complete with custom hardware and software and all you have to do is plug in the kit in your car's OBD 2 port and install a few apps in order to get level 2 self driving functionality. Just like Tesla you will receive Over the Air updates on the kit(just like your smart phone) as succesive versions are developed. Hands should be on the wheels at all times and the driver should be ready to take back manual control at any time. And of course, before shipping such a product we are going to make sure that it is in full compliance with the industry guidelines as per the rules set by the Govt of India. 

### Hiring

A final decision on hiring is yet to be made. Will keep you posted.

### Safety

- As mentioned in the introduction, System-X is working on developing ADAS features, such as Adaptive cruice control (ACC) and Automated Lane Centering (ALC). The V-0.0.0 beta version is not compatible with any car at the moment. We are in the process of developing a version that will be tested on a vehicle.
- For the present version, we are including a driver monitoring algorithm, that will recognise the current driver state and transmit a warning signal in order to maximise attention. A fallback condition on limiting actuator functionality based on the driver's current state will be added.

- **Is the code published in this repo road legal ?**

As of August 2020, there are no specific laws in India that can effectively assess the functional safety of an ADAS software which makes it applicable to run on Indian roads. On the flip side, there are also no regulations that are currently regulating you(the viewer of this repo) or any other company who wants to build their own ADAS software, install it in their cars and test it on the streets. But, since public safety is of absolute importance, there should be zero compromise on the assessment of functional safety of said ADAS software, even while testing. So, the succeeding versions of System-X software that will be compatible with cars (in the future), will be developed following the guidelines proposed by the NHTSA. (that is the only one we found to be detailed and extensive). The code developed by System-X will abide by industry standards as prescribed by ISO 26262(international standard for functional safety of electrical and/or electronic systems) and also comply with industry safety standards/guidelines set forth by the Govt. of India.

 - If you (indiviual or company) decide to use the code pertaining to Pilot-X to build your own ADAS , please make sure that your use case is in full compliance with the local laws of your state/country and meets the automotive industry standards. If not, then you need to modify the code/build on top of Pilot-X.


### The state of jobs due to self driving cars

**The Driver won't be eliminated. Our understanding of what constitutes as driving will evolve and as a result the role of the driver will undergo a shift**

A common misconception among the general consensus is that self driving cars will come at a cost of drivers. Autonomous vehicles will eliminate drivers as the technology scales up. Statements like these cannot be further from the truth. Let's use our imagination for a moment. Hypothetically, If level 5 autonomous vehicles drops in right here, right now, what sort of reaction do you think that will elicit from the mass as it becomes commercially available. Don't you think that there will be atleast one person in the car who will be paying attention to the road especially if the driver is absent from the wheel. 

- **Here is the reason**
The definition of the 5 levels of self driving ranges from minimal to no human intervention right ?. But that is not exactly how human attention works. Let's assume you are in an Uber Taxi, which is a level 5 autonomous vehicle for you, not the driver, because you don't have to be engaged with the system to drive. The uber driver is.

- Ask yourself , will you be able to recognise or even pay the slighest amount of attention if the car enters a tunnel, or is driving atop of a flyover. You may not be engaged in paying any direct attention to the roads or driving , but you are paying attention to the current situation the car is in. The situational awareness is present at all times. So, even though the hypothetical level 5 autonomous system has "eliminated" the traditional role of the driver, it hasn't been able to fully eliminate attention, which is an integral aspect of driving . We as humans are yet to make that transition where we can fully relinquish attention and situational awareness and become completely reliant on the system. This is also why we think that the 5 levels of autonomous driving are shoddily defined.

So, if somebody is paying attention even with the hypothetical level 5, at full capacity, is the driver really eliminated ?. Yes his traditional role of hand eye coordination will be eliminated, but his attention won't be. You are going to have atleast one person who is paying attention and that burden surely won't fall on the passengers. Therefore, essentially, the driver won't be eliminated. And Level 5 is atleast a decade away, if we make a conservative estimation.

What will undergo a significant change is what constitutes as driving. Less focus on the manual coordination and more attention on the roads. Driving will become much more relaxing if you manage to eliminate the need for manual coordination. 

Also, you will need the driver to take back manual control at any time and override the system. You will also need the driver to produce the license if the cops pull you over..!
