### About


We here at System-X are currently working towards perfecting level 2 autonomous driving in India.
Pilot-X is an open source Driver's assistance system (Currently under development)

### Goal

### Hiring

### Safety

- As mentioned in the introduction, System-X is working on developing ADAS features, such as Adaptive cruice control (ACC) and Automated Lane Centering (ALC). For the V-0.0.0 beta version, the driver's hands should always be present on the wheel, ready to take back manual control at any time. This is a system, that acts as a failsafe system. 
- For the present version, we are including a driver monitoring algorithm, that will recognise the current driver state and transmit a warning signal in order to maximise attention. A fallback condition on limiting actuator functionality based on the driver's current state will be added.
